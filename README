NAME
    Pod::Elemental::Transformer::List::Converter - Convert a list to...
    something else

VERSION
    This document describes 0.001 of
    Pod::Elemental::Transformer::List::Converter - released February 27,
    2012 as part of Pod-Elemental-Transformer-List-Converter.

SYNOPSIS
        # somewhere inside your code...
        my $transformer = Pod::Elemental::Transformer::List::Converter->new;
        $transformer->transform_node($node);

DESCRIPTION
    This Pod::Elemental::Transformer takes a given node's children, and
    converts any list commands to another command, "head2" by default.

    That is:

    "=item" becomes "=head2", and
    "=over" and <=back> commands are dropped entirely.

    As you can imagine, it's important to be selective with the nodes you
    run through this transformer -- if you pass the entire document to it,
    it will obliterate any lists found.

ATTRIBUTES
  command
    The command we change "=item" elements to; defaults to "head2".

METHODS
  command
    Accessor to the command attribute.

  transform_node($node)
    Takes a node, and replaces any "=item"'s with our target command (by
    default, "=head2"). We also drop any command elements found for "=over"
    and "=back".
